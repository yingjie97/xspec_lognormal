# xspec_lognormal
Xspec fitting models for thermal plasma, with log-normal temperature and absorption distribution

Use for fitting thermal X-ray emission in Xspec, allowing a log-normal distribution of temperature and foreground absorption. The thermal plasma model 'vlntd' is modified from 'vapec', where a mean temperature and a temperature dispersion are defined instead of a single temperature. The foreground absorption model 'lnwabs' is modified from 'wabs', where a mean H column density (NH) and it's dispersion are defined instead of a single NH.
